## Introduction

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific day of the Advent of Code challenge. Inside each directory, you'll find the Rust source code for solving that day's puzzle. The solutions are organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/advent_of_code_2023
  â”œâ”€â”€ 01
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input_short.txt
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”œâ”€â”€ 02
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input_short.txt
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- Each day's directory contains an `input.txt` file with the full puzzle input and an `input_short.txt` file with the initial snippet provided in the puzzle text.
- The `src` directory within each day contains the Rust source code (`main.rs`) for solving the puzzle.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yaxit/advent-of-code-2023.git
```

2. Change into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd advent-of-code-2023
```

3. Start exploring the solutions!

## Running Solutions

Navigate to the specific day's directory you want to run and execute the following command:

```bash
cd 01  # Change to the desired day's directory
cargo run -- input.txt
```

Replace `01` with the appropriate day's directory.
